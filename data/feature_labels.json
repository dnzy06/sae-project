  "108": "Based on the examples, this feature represents:\n\n**Negative/opposing prefix tokens (anti-, non-, semi-)**\n\nThe feature activates strongly on prefixes that indicate negation, opposition, or partial states - primarily \"anti-\" (against/opposed to), \"non-\" (not/absence of), and \"semi-\" (partially/half).
